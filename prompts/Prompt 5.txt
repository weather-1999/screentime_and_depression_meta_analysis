# Role Context
You are Claude Opus 4.5.

Act as an epidemiology data auditor with expertise in meta-analysis.
Effect size estimates from nine (9) prospective cohort studies examining the association between screen time and depression were already extracted and pooled estimate computed using an LLM-based pipeline.

Your task is to **quantitatively compare** the LLM-extracted effect size values with reference values reported in Guo & Guo, the reference paper, focusing on **agreement of effect size estimates**.

All logarithmic operations MUST use the **natural logarithm (base-e)**.

# MODEL GATING [CRITICAL]
Before proceeding:
- Confirm explicitly that you are running as **Claude Opus 4.5**.
- If you are NOT Claude Opus 4.5, STOP immediately and report this.
- Do NOT proceed under any other model.

# Input Data
Two CSV files will be provided directly with this prompt:

1) Reference effect size values (manually curated from Guo & Guo):
   File name: Task2_Reference_9_studies.csv

2) LLM-extracted effect size values:
   File name: Task2_Statistics_9_studies.csv

Notes:
- Task2_Reference_9_studies.csv does NOT contain columns for Original_ES or Direction_Action.
- Confidence interval bounds are provided but are NOT used for comparison in this task.

# Goal
Generate a table titled:

**Table 3. Comparison of reference and LLM-extracted effect size values**

This table should quantify agreement between Guo & Guo’s reported odds ratios
and the LLM-extracted odds ratios using absolute differences on the natural log scale.

# Operational Logic (Comparison Rules)

## Step 1. Preprocessing
- Convert all values to string format.
- Convert strings to lowercase.
- Strip leading and trailing whitespace.
- Match studies STRICTLY by Study_ID.
- If a Study_ID is present in one file but not the other, exclude it from comparison
  and report this explicitly.

## Step 2. Study Inclusion / Exclusion
- Exclude **Kandola et al., 2021** from all comparisons because the primary reported
  effect size in the original study is an IRR rather than an OR.
- Perform comparisons only on studies with ORs in BOTH files.

## Step 3. Metric Computation (Study-level)
For each included study, compute:

\[
|Δ \ln(OR)| = \left| \ln(OR_{LLM}) - \ln(OR_{Guo}) \right|
\]

Where:
- ln() is the natural logarithm.
- OR_Guo is taken from Task2_Reference_9_studies.csv.
- OR_LLM is taken from Task2_Statistics_9_studies.csv.

Confidence intervals must NOT be used in this computation.

## Step 4. Pooled Effect Comparison
- Compute pooled ORs for:
  a) Guo & Guo reference values
  b) LLM-extracted values
- Use the SAME random-effects model for both.
- Exclude Kandola et al., 2021 from pooled estimates.
- Compute absolute difference in natural log scale between pooled ORs.

## Step 5. Interpretation Rules
Interpret |Δ ln(OR)| using the following guide:
- < 0.05 → Practically identical
- 0.05–0.10 → Minor discrepancy
- > 0.10 → Meaningful divergence

Notes:
- Use absolute differences only.
- Do NOT perform hypothesis testing.
- Focus on agreement, not statistical superiority.
