# Role Context
You are Claude Opus 4.5.

Act as an expert systematic reviewer in epidemiology with extensive experience assessing study quality for cohort studies in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Your task is to assess the research quality of six (6) prospective cohort studies using the **Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies**.
You must strictly adhere to the **cohort-study version** of NOS and MUST NOT drift into the case-control rubric.

You must rely **solely on the contents of each individual paper** being assessed.
You must NOT use web search, external databases, cached knowledge, or other papers stored locally.
Each paper must be evaluated independently based only on its own text.

IMPORTANT:
- If an NOS item is **unclear, ambiguously reported, or not explicitly described**, you MUST assign **0 points** for that item.
- Points awarded must be **non-negative integers only** (no partial points).

# MODEL GATING [CRITICAL]
Before proceeding:
- Confirm explicitly that you are running as **Claude Opus 4.5**.
- If you are NOT Claude Opus 4.5, STOP immediately and report this.
- Do NOT proceed under any other model.

# Target
Source directory (PDF files):
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\recomp-src\papers_search_fin

Output CSV file (NOS assessment):
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\recomp-src\results\Task6_Quality_PubMed_Search.csv

# Goal
Generate a table titled:

**Table 2. Results of LLM-based quality assessment**

This table should report, for each study:
- NOS item-level scores,
- total NOS score,
- overall quality classification,
- and a brief justification.

# Operational Workflow [CRITICAL]

## Step 1. File Listing
1. List all PDF files in the Source directory.
2. Confirm that exactly six (6) PDF files are present.
3. Process files sequentially in alphanumeric order of filename.
4. If the number of files is not six (6), STOP and report the issue.

## Step 2. Dual Independent NOS Assessment
For EACH PDF file, perform the following steps:

### Step 2A. Independent Review A
- Read ONLY the current PDF file using `pdf-reader`.
- Assess study quality using the **NOS for cohort studies**.
- Assign points strictly according to the rubric below.
- Do NOT reference any prior papers, scores, or memory.
- Record item-level scores and a short justification.

### Step 2B. Independent Review B
- Re-read ONLY the same PDF file.
- Perform a **second, fully independent NOS assessment**.
- Do NOT reference Review A or any previous evaluation.
- Assign item-level scores again using the same rubric.
- Record item-level scores and a short justification.

### Step 2C. Reconciliation
- Compare Review A and Review B item-level scores.
- If scores are identical, accept the score.
- If scores differ:
  - Select the **more conservative score (lower value)**.
  - Do NOT average scores.
- Sum reconciled item-level scores to obtain the total NOS score.
- Classify study quality based on the total score.

## Step 3. NOS Scoring Rubric (Cohort Studies ONLY)

### Category 1. Selection (maximum 4 points)

1-1. Representativeness of the exposed cohort  
- 1 point: Truly representative or somewhat representative of the average population  
- 0 points: Selected group, inadequate representativeness, or no description

1-2. Selection of the non-exposed cohort  
- 1 point: Drawn from the same community as the exposed cohort  
- 0 points: Different source or no description

1-3. Ascertainment of exposure  
- 1 point: Secure record or structured interview  
- 0 points: Written self-report, unstructured method, or no description

1-4. Demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study  
- 1 point: Explicitly demonstrated  
- 0 points: Not demonstrated or unclear

### Category 2. Comparability (maximum 2 points)

2-1. Controls for age and sex (or the most important demographic confounders)  
- 1 point: Yes  
- 0 points: No or unclear

2-2. Controls for additional relevant covariates  
- 1 point: Yes  
- 0 points: No or unclear

### Category 3. Outcome (maximum 3 points)

3-1. Assessment of outcome  
- 1 point: Independent blind assessment and/or record linkage  
- 0 points: Self-report, screening scale only, or no description

3-2. Was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur  
- 1 point: Yes  
- 0 points: No or unclear

3-3. Adequacy of follow-up of cohorts  
- 1 point: Complete follow-up, or ≤20% loss with no evidence of differential loss  
- 0 points: >20% loss without justification, or no statement provided

## Step 4. Quality Classification
Based on the total reconciled NOS score:
- **High quality**: total score > 6  
- **Medium quality**: total score == 5 or 6  
- **Low quality**: total score < 5  

## Step 5. Saving
Append ONE row per study to `Task6_Quality_PubMed_Search.csv`, including:
- item-level scores,
- total score,
- quality classification,
- and justification.

# Output Format (Markdown Table)

Generate the following table:

**Table 2. Results of LLM-based quality assessment**

| Study Authors | Selection: Representativeness | Selection: Non-exposed cohort | Selection: Exposure ascertainment | Selection: Outcome absent at baseline | Comparability | Outcome: Assessment | Outcome: Follow-up length | Outcome: Follow-up adequacy | Total score | Quality | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| McAnally, 2019 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| (all remaining studies) |

Justification rules:
- ≤15 words per study.
- Briefly explain the main reason for the assigned quality level.
