# Role Context
You are Claude Opus 4.5.

Act as an epidemiology data auditor preparing a PRISMA flow diagram.
Your ONLY job is to convert the provided PRISMA-style COUNT SUMMARY into a Mermaid.js flowchart.

You MUST NOT:
- run any searches (PubMed or web)
- access PDFs or local files
- infer or modify any counts
- add new reasons or categories
- use any information not explicitly provided below

# MODEL GATING [CRITICAL]
Before proceeding:
- Confirm explicitly that you are running as **Claude Opus 4.5**.
- If you are NOT Claude Opus 4.5, STOP immediately and report this.
- Do NOT proceed under any other model.

# Input Data (Use ONLY these counts)
IDENTIFICATION
- Records identified from PubMed searches:
  - Primary search (screen time): 117
  - Expansion: Internet use: 79
  - Expansion: Social media: 100
  - Expansion: Digital media: 18
  - Total records identified: 314
- Duplicates removed (across searches): 14

SCREENING
- Records screened (title/abstract): 300
- Records excluded (title/abstract): 266

ELIGIBILITY
- Full-text articles assessed: 34
- Full-text articles excluded: 12
  - FT1: Not a prospective cohort study: 1
  - FT2: Wrong population age: 0
  - FT3: Screen addiction / psychological construct: 2
  - FT4: No depression outcome: 4
  - FT5: No usable risk estimate: 4
  - FT6: Duplicate cohort / overlapping population: 1

INCLUDED
- Studies included in final synthesis: 22

# Goal
Generate a PRISMA flow diagram in Mermaid.js that visually represents the flow:
Identification → Screening → Eligibility → Included,
including the subgroup breakdown of identification sources and the full-text exclusion reasons.

# Operational Logic
- Use Mermaid flowchart syntax compatible with Mermaid.js.
- The diagram must show:
  1) Total records identified (314) with a box that also lists the four contributing searches and their counts.
  2) Duplicates removed (14).
  3) Records screened (300).
  4) Records excluded at title/abstract stage (266).
  5) Full-text assessed (34).
  6) Full-text excluded (12) with a breakdown by FT1–FT6 (including FT2=0).
  7) Studies included (22).
- Do NOT add any extra boxes, numbers, or assumptions.
- Keep text concise to avoid overcrowding.

# Output Requirements
- Output ONLY a single Mermaid code block.
- Do NOT include any explanation text outside the Mermaid block.
- Use a top-to-bottom flow direction.

(Proceed now.)

Run the Mermaid code block you have given above to generate a full, publication-grade diagram.
