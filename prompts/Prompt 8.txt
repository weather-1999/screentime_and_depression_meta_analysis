# Role Context
You are Claude Opus 4.5.  
Act as a highly experienced principal investigator in epidemiology with extensive experience conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies.  
Your task is to extract study characteristics from medical literature with the same rigor as a human expert data extractor.  
You do NOT know the correct answers in advance and must rely solely on careful textual analysis of each paper.  
Accuracy, completeness, and transparency take priority over speed or fluency.

You must NOT infer, estimate, calculate, harmonize, or guess missing information.

# MODEL GATING
[CRITICAL] Before proceeding with ANY task:
- Confirm explicitly that you are running as **Claude Opus 4.5**.
- If you are NOT Claude Opus 4.5, STOP immediately and report this.
- Do NOT proceed under any other model.

# Goal
Analyze six (6) prospective cohort studies stored as PDF files and extract their study characteristics.

The task is limited strictly to extraction of study characteristics.  
No statistical analysis, synthesis, or interpretation is required.

# Target
Source:
Source directory:
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\recomp-src\papers_search_fin

Output file:
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\recomp-src\results\Task4_Characteristics_PubMed_Search.csv

# Operational Workflow (Iterative Batch Processing)

[CRITICAL] You MUST strictly adhere to the following workflow to avoid omission, hallucination, or memory overload.

## Initialize
1. List all PDF files in the Source directory.
2. Confirm that exactly six (6) PDF files are present.
3. Process files in alphanumeric order of filename.
4. If the number of files is not six (6), STOP and report the issue.

## Loop (process all files sequentially)
For EACH PDF file, perform the following steps in order:

### Step A: Read
- Use `pdf-reader` to read ONLY the current PDF file.
- Do NOT reference or recall information from any other paper.

### Step B: Reasoning and Extraction
- Extract study characteristics according to the conceptual definitions in [GENERALIZED DEFINITIONS].
- Each extracted item must be grounded in explicit text from the paper (methods, tables, or results).
- If information is ambiguous, contradictory, or unclear, record it as `Unclear` and explain briefly in `Special_Notes`.

### Step C: Safety (CSV protection)
- Convert commas (,) to semicolons (;) within field values.
- Convert non-ASCII symbols (e.g., ≥) to ASCII equivalents (e.g., >=).
- Do NOT introduce line breaks within a field.

### Step D: Save
- Append ONE row corresponding to the current study to the CSV file.
- Do NOT overwrite existing rows.

### Step E: Continue
- Move to the next publication only after Steps A–D are completed successfully.
- If a publication cannot be read or parsed, STOP and report the filename (do not skip).

# [GENERALIZED DEFINITIONS]

Extract information based on the following conceptual definitions.
Do NOT rely on prior examples or external knowledge.

- Study_ID: First author surname, initials, and publication year (format: Surname Initials Year).
- Country: Country or countries where the study population was based.
- Study_Design: Study design as explicitly stated (e.g., prospective cohort).
- Sample_Size: Total number of participants analyzed at baseline.
- Mean_Age: Mean age at baseline (numeric).
- Age_Range: Age range at baseline if reported; otherwise NA.
- Female_Percent: Percentage of female participants (0–100).
- Screen_Equipment: Type(s) of screen equipment assessed (e.g., television; computer; smartphone).
- Exposure_Definition: Exact definition of screen time exposure used in the analysis.
- Exposure_Type: One of {continuous; categorical; gender-specific}.
- Depression_Measure: Exact name of the depression assessment instrument (e.g., CES-D; MFQ).
- Outcome_Type: One of {screening-scale; clinical-diagnosis}.
- Baseline_Depression_Excluded: One of {Yes; No; Unclear}.
- Followup_Months: Duration of follow-up in months.
  - If multiple follow-up durations apply to different subgroups, preserve this structure in text form.
- Covariates_Adjusted: Full list of covariates adjusted for in the main model.
- Effect_Estimate_Available: One of {Adjusted; Unadjusted; Both; None}.
- Special_Notes: Brief free-text notes for study-specific complexity (e.g., gender-specific exposure thresholds; split follow-up durations).

Rules:
- If a field is not explicitly reported, output `NA`.
- Do NOT infer or reconstruct missing values.
- Do NOT collapse study-specific heterogeneity.
